My past week was very interesting!

## Monday

My Monday started with a dictation in Russian, among the entire first year, and then it went, as usual, six pairs (three English pairs from 15:00 to 19:20, linear algebra lecture from 13:30 to 14:50, computer science and programming technologies (remotely) from 9:00 to 10:20.

## Tuesday

I went to Spanish, where we wrote a test, after the pair I went to meet a friend, we had a lot of fun together

## Wednesday

Wednesday is a very hard day for me, in the morning I had discrete mathematics, then mathematical analysis. Immediately after it I went to the main building of RUDN for my next pair on Fundamentals of Military Training, where we were taught to operate UAVs, on April 30 there will be the last test and a pair on this subject.

## Thursday

Thursday is a very relaxed day, with only 2 classes: linear algebra and history of religion in Russia. I didn't have time to present my report on Easter in the class on the history of religions in Russia because I didn't have enough time. After the classes, I went to meet a friend and we went for a boat ride, the photo in the post is from there.

## Friday

In the morning, I have two lectures on mathematical analysis, then I have a class on the foundations of Russian statehood, where I presented a project, got 14 points, and the final class on Friday is the history of Russia.

## Saturday

Saturday began with morning distance lectures on the history of Russia and the history of religions in Russia. I wrote a detailed summary for the history of religions in Russia. Then I studied Computer Science and Programming Technologies and posted the twelfth lab work.

## Sunday

I am studying Computer Science and Programming Technologies and doing an individual project, stage 4.
