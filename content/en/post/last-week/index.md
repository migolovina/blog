My past week was very eventful and interesting!

## Monday

Monday is a hard day, I have six classes (three English classes from 15:00 to 19:20, linear algebra lecture from 13:30 to 14:50, computer science and programming technologies (remotely) from 9:00 to 10:20), immediately after them I leave the house and hurry to linear algebra.

## Tuesday

I got into the working rhythm. I went to a Spanish class and went shopping with friends, there I saw a beautiful headband, in which I took a photo.

## Wednesday

Wednesday is a very hard day for me, in the morning I had discrete mathematics, then a test in mathematical analysis, a rehearsal of a song that my group and I will sing in Spanish on March 17, 2025 at the performance. Immediately after that I went to the main building RUDN for my next class on Fundamentals of Military Training.

## Thursday

Thursday is a very relaxed day, where there are only 2 classes: linear algebra and history of religion in Russia. In the class on the history of religions in Russia, I presented my report on the topic: "The main holidays in Judaism". For this report, I received 9 points out of 10, I think this is a good result, I also worked on the class and received 6 points.

## Friday

In the morning, I have two lectures on mathematical analysis, then I have a class on the foundations of Russian statehood, where I worked and received 2 points, and the final class on Friday is the history of Russia, where I presented a report on Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov, our teacher said that I was very well prepared and gave me the maximum score for this task.

## Saturday

Saturday started with morning remote lectures on Russian history and Russian religious history. I wrote detailed notes on Russian religious history to choose a topic for my report and present it next Thursday. Then I studied Computer Science and Programming Technologies and posted the fifth lab assignment.

## Sunday

I am studying Computer Science and Programming Technologies and doing an individual project, stage 2.
