My last week was full of childhood memories.

## Monday

On Monday I had to take an English test, I got 52 points, that's B2. I installed a game from my childhood, which I watched reviews on 12 years ago, it was so wonderful to play something I've been dreaming about for a long time.

## Tuesday

I installed another game from my childhood, which I didn't really like, but I decided to finish it and I'm still doing it.

## Wednesday

On Wednesday I was able to download my most desired childhood game and play it, but unfortunately, all the games from my childhood are designed for a joystick, which I don’t have, and on the computer it’s impossible to complete it because of this. :(

## Thursday

On Thursday I had a day off and decided to go for a walk, there I met a very cute ginger cat, for whom I bought food, after that he walked with me the whole walk.

## Friday

On Friday all the classes were moved to distance learning, so I downloaded my ninth history assignment to disk and didn’t present it.

## Saturday

I started doing my computer science project and did the last fourteenth lab assignment.

## Sunday

I finished all the lab assignments and am doing the penultimate stage of the project.
