I really liked the events that happened to me this week.

## Monday

Monday this week was wonderful. My morning started off great with a distance class on one of my favorite subjects, discrete mathematics. Then I went to the university, where we had a spring festival, where I performed in two skits, sang the song Despacito and recited a poem about spring. I went home in a great mood and went to bed.

## Tuesday

Unfortunately, on Tuesday they cancelled our Spanish class, but they gave us additional homework, which I did very well. Then I went to the hospital to have my tooth treated, they treated it in two hours and I went home.

## Wednesday

Wednesday started off very hard for me, I had to get up at 7:30 in the morning, I woke up very tired and didn't want to go anywhere and dreamed that Thursday would come soon (after all, my mother is coming to visit me on Thursday), I got up and went to my classes, my first was discrete mathematics, then two mathematical analyses, after which I immediately went to the main building of RUDN for OVP. And I returned home at 22:30.

## Thursday

Thursday was the most anticipated day for me this week. I woke up and immediately went to meet my mother, when we met, we were very happy, because we hadn't seen each other since the New Year. After our meeting, I went to a class on linear algebra. It went very quickly and interestingly. After that, my mom and I went to my dorm to clean up. After that, we went to eat and went to the hotel.

## Friday

In the morning, I went to class, I had mathematical analysis and classes on the basics of Russian statehood and the history of Russia. After that, my mom and I went to eat Hong Kong waffles, my mom had wanted to try them for a long time. After that, we went to the hotel and I sat down to do my assignment on "Computer Science and Programming Technologies".

## Saturday

In the morning, I had lectures on ORG and History of Russia. Then I sat down to do my assignment on "Computer Science and Programming Technologies". After that, I had a lunch break and my mom and I went to the "Ramen Club" and ate very tasty ramen.

## Sunday

All Sunday, I studied Computer Science and Programming Technologies and am doing an individual project, stage 3.
